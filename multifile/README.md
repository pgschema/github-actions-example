# Multi-file Schema Dump

Each file represents a different database object. Different database object types are organized into different directories. The entire directory represents
the whole schema. The dump is generated by:

```bash
pgschema dump --host localhost --user postgres --password testpwd1 --db employee --multi-file --file main.sql
```

`main.sql` is the entry file that uses `psql` compatible `\i` directive to include other files.
